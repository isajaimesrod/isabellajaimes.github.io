#### I am an STS and CSCW researcher, my research focus on how technology shapes and mediate relations within immigrant Latinx communities. My work explores the intersection of technology, labor, and social justice, focusing on marginalized communities' experiences and challenges in digital spaces. I am part of Socio-technical Resistance and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab, University of Toronto

## On Going Research Projects
**El costo de la independencia: Latino house-cleaners in Technology-Mediated Labour Markets(_June 2022 - Present_)**

I'm researching how identity and digital marketplaces shape the experiences of Latino house-cleaners in Toronto. Through 19 interviews, I explored how these workers use digital tools for flexibility while facing precarity, and how their collective identity fosters solidarity and sororidades

## Completed research projects

**The Digital Boss: Algorithms, Housekeeping apps and the digitalisation of domestic work in Colombia**

We conducted research on how domestic work platforms in Colombia, affect workers'
employment and social relations through algorithmic governance. Using ethnographic approaches and interviews, we explored their matching, ranking, and pricing systems to inform more equitable platorm designs for Latin America.


**Between compliance and resistance: Social media interactions and representation of fitness and healthy lifestyles among young people in Colombia**

Our research investigated how Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook shape mental health conversations in Spanish-speaking communities. We reveal that platforms like Facebook rely on data-driven credibility, while Instagram and TikTok foster personal, experiential narratives. Additionally, we explored significant gendered digital violence in health-related discussions, affecting marginalized voices. Our work calls for platform-specific strategies to create safer, more informed spaces for mental health dialogue.

**Mapping Movement: The Role of Technology in Shaping Urban Mobilities and Ride-Hailing Driver Experiences**

I research how digital platforms shape ride-hailing driver experiences in Bogotá, revealing the interplay of technology, socio-spatial dynamics, and drivers'adaptive strategies that challenge algorithmic control and reshape urban mobility practices.
